abstract = {a b s t r a c t Although dementia praecox or schizophrenia has been considered a unique disease for over a century, its def-initions and boundaries have changed over this period and its etiology and pathophysiology remain elusive. Despite changing definitions, DSM-IV schizophrenia is reliably diagnosed, has fair validity and conveys useful clinical information. Therefore, the essence of the broad DSM-IV definition of schizophrenia is retained in DSM-5. The clinical manifestations are extremely diverse, however, with this heterogeneity being poorly explained by the DSM-IV clinical subtypes and course specifiers. Additionally, the boundaries of schizophre-nia are imprecisely demarcated from schizoaffective disorder and other diagnostic categories and its special emphasis on Schneiderian " first-rank " symptoms appears misplaced. Changes in the definition of schizophre-nia in DSM-5 seek to address these shortcomings and incorporate the new information about the nature of the disorder accumulated over the past two decades. Specific changes in its definition include elimination of the classic subtypes, addition of unique psychopathological dimensions, clarification of cross-sectional and longitudinal course specifiers, elimination of special treatment of Schneiderian 'first-rank symptoms', better delineation of schizophrenia from schizoaffective disorder, and clarification of the relationship of schizophrenia to catatonia. These changes should improve diagnosis and characterization of individuals with schizophrenia and facilitate measurement-based treatment and concurrently provide a more useful platform for research that will elucidate its nature and permit a more precise future delineation of the 'schizophrenias'.},

abstract = {Coherence in Aphasia: Implementation of Different Measurement Procedures 3 Coherence is a semantic property of the text to make sense to readers or listeners and is crucial for any text. Various coherence measures have been developed for assessment of discourse abilities in different clinical populations. However, the results of decades of research on coherence of speech of individuals with brain damage have yielded contradictive results. We suggest that this might be due to the different sensitivity of the methods. In this study we two measures of global coherence and five measures of local coherence on the same set of texts by healthy speakers of Russian and people with dynamic aphasia in order to find which methods allow to distinguish between the two groups and how these results correlate. The material for the study is texts from the Russian CliPS corpus which is a collection of oral retellings of the pear film by individuals with brain damage and healthy speakers of Russian language.},

Discourse abilities of brain-damaged individuals are still under discussion, and Russian CliPS (Clinical Pear Stories) corpus was created for the thorough analysis of micro-and macro-linguistic levels of narratives by PWA and RHD. The current version of Russian СliPS contains 39 narratives by people with various forms of aphasia due to left hemisphere damage, 5 narratives by people with right hemisphere damage and no aphasia, and 22 narratives by neurologically healthy adults. The annotation scheme of Russian CliPS 1.0 includes the following tiers: quasiphonetic, lexical, lemma, part of speech tags, grammatical properties, errors, laughter, segmentation into clauses and utterances. Also analysis of such measures as informativeness, local and global coherence, anaphora, and macrostructure is planned as a next stage of the corpus development.},

abstract = {A group with closed head injury was compared to neurologically intact controls regarding the referential cohesion and logical coherence of narrative production. A sample of six stories was obtained with tasks of cartoon-elicited story-telling and auditory-oral retelling. We found deficits in the clinical group with respect to referential cohesion, logical coherence, and accuracy of narration. The occurrence of deficits depended on the condition of narrative production and, to some extent, on the particular story used. The primary implications of this study pertain to the attention given by researchers to the feature of discourse production being studied and processing demands of the task. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Ditman2010,
abstract = {Clinically, patients with schizophrenia show prominent abnormalities at the discourse level, with production characterized by tangential and illogical relationships between ideas and unclear references. Despite these clinical manifestations, most studies of language in schizophrenia have focused on semantic relationships between single words and the build-up of meaning within single-clause sentences. The present paper discusses the few studies that have gone beyond clause boundaries to fully understand language impairments in schizophrenia. We also give an overview of a relevant literature that considers the neurocognitive mechanisms by which coherence links are established across clauses in healthy adults, providing a framework that may guide future research in this area. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Chafe1980,
abstract = {The study of narrative discourse, as exemplified in the essays in this book, treats the unfolding of narrative and the expression of this unfolding narrative in words.1 The opening scene is set, characters and objects introduced, and events described, as the narrative shifts from scene to scene. In approaching this phenomenon, one may choose to examine the portioning of narrative content into discourse units (Chafe, Chapter 1), the selection of a prominent referent to take on the role of subject in a clause (Bernardo, Chapter 6), or the influence of the larger cultural context on the expression of events and evaluations (Tannen, Chapter 2). Or, one may focus on a phenomenon of narrower scope: the verbalization of characters and objects within the discourse. This is the domain of the essays that Downing and Clancy contributed to this book and of the present chapter. Though apparently narrow, the topic has two distinct aspects. On the one hand, one may consider the static aspect of nominal verbalization. The speaker is confronted by an object whose semantic substance requires expression. He must draw on his cultural knowledge and his understanding of his addressee in order to decide what is salient and hence worthy of verbalization, and he employs his semantic knowledge in the expression of the appropriate categorization. Downing deals with this facet of the problem. But 'This study was partially supported by NIMH Grant MH25592.1 wish to thank the Director of the "pear film project," Wallace Chafe, and my co-workers Robert Bernardo, Patricia Clancy, Pamela Downing, Nancy Ickler, and Deborah Tannen for their comments, general and specific, and especially for contributing to the exceptionally stimulating environment of the project which taught me so much.
